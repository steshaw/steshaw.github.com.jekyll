h2. Understanding me

Many years ago, I did the "Keirsey Temperament Sorter":http://keirsey.com/. There are two: a short one and a longer one. I was "diagnosed" as "INTJ (Mastermind/Scientist)":http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html on both.

Subsequently, I took a standard Myer-Briggs personality test which came up with "INTP (Architect/Thinker)":http://www.personalitypage.com/INTP.html. This is a more typical profile for a computer programmer.
